# Project Conventions

This document is the single source of truth for architecture,
code quality, and testing standards in this project. Other skills
reference it rather than duplicating these rules.

## Project Stack

This is a full-stack monorepo:

- **Frontend:** Next.js 16 (App Router) + React 19 + shadcn/ui +
  Tailwind CSS v4 (TypeScript, in `frontend/`)
- **Backend:** FastAPI + Uvicorn + Pydantic (Python 3.11+, in
  `backend/`)

## Architecture Principles

### Backend-for-Frontend (BFF) Pattern

The browser NEVER calls the FastAPI backend directly. All backend
communication flows through the Next.js server layer:

- **Server Actions** (`app/actions.ts`) handle form submissions
  and data mutations. Client components call these actions, which
  run on the Next.js server and proxy requests to FastAPI.
- **API Routes** (`app/api/*/route.ts`) exist ONLY for external
  consumers (e.g. health check monitors). They are NOT used by
  the frontend itself.

This pattern eliminates CORS issues and keeps backend URLs and
secrets hidden from the client.

### Type Safety at the Boundary (Zod Contracts)

Every FastAPI response is validated on the frontend with Zod:

- `lib/contracts.ts` defines Zod schemas mirroring FastAPI's
  Pydantic models.
- `lib/backend-client.ts` provides `backendJson()`, which fetches
  from FastAPI and validates the response against a Zod schema.
- If the API contract breaks, the frontend fails fast with a
  clear `BackendRequestError` rather than rendering undefined
  states.

When adding a new endpoint, ALWAYS:

1. Add a Pydantic response model in `backend/api/schemas.py`.
2. Add a matching Zod schema in `frontend/lib/contracts.ts`.
3. Add a contract test in `frontend/tests/contracts.test.ts`.
4. Use `backendJson()` with the schema in the Server Action.

### Server Components vs Client Components

- **Server Components** (default, no directive) fetch data on the
  server and pass it as props to client components. Use for pages
  and data-fetching wrappers.
- **Client Components** (`'use client'` directive) handle
  interactivity, browser APIs, and React hooks. Keep them focused
  on UX; delegate data fetching to Server Actions.

### React 19 Patterns

- Use `useActionState` (not the deprecated `useFormState`) for
  form submissions with pending states.
- Define state types explicitly (e.g. `GreetingState` in
  `lib/greeting-state.ts`) for Server Action return values.
- Use `useEffect` for side effects like toast notifications on
  state changes.

### Backend Structure

- **Lifespan management:** `main.py` uses the
  `@asynccontextmanager` lifespan pattern for startup/shutdown
  logic (e.g. creating and closing `httpx.AsyncClient`). NEVER
  use the deprecated `@app.on_event` decorators.
- **Pydantic Settings:** `config.py` uses `pydantic-settings` for
  typed configuration from environment variables.
- **Versioned routers:** Endpoints live under `api/v1/` with an
  `APIRouter`. New endpoints go in new or existing router files
  under `api/v1/`.
- **Typed responses:** Every endpoint declares `response_model`
  and returns a Pydantic model instance.

## Code Quality

### Python (Backend)

- **Python 3.11+:** Use modern syntax - type hints everywhere,
  `from __future__ import annotations` when needed, `|` union
  syntax, `Annotated` for FastAPI dependencies.
- **Async first:** All endpoint handlers must be `async def`.
  Use `httpx.AsyncClient` (not `requests`) for outbound HTTP.
- **Type hints:** Every function parameter and return value must
  have type hints. Use `Annotated` for FastAPI query/path/body
  parameters.
- **Docstrings:** Every module, class, and public function must
  have a docstring. Use imperative mood for function docstrings.
- **Error handling:** Use FastAPI's `HTTPException` for API errors.
  Use Pydantic validation for input validation. Never swallow
  exceptions silently.
- **Import grouping:** Standard library, blank line, third-party,
  blank line, local imports.
- **Line width:** 88-column limit (ruff default).
- **Naming:** snake_case for functions and variables,
  PascalCase for classes. Self-documenting names.

### TypeScript (Frontend)

- **Strict TypeScript:** The project uses `strict: true`. Never
  use `any` unless absolutely unavoidable (and document why).
  Prefer `unknown` with type narrowing.
- **Zod for runtime validation:** Use Zod schemas for all external
  data. Derive TypeScript types with `z.infer<>` rather than
  defining types separately.
- **Server Actions:** Mark with `'use server'` at the top of the
  file. Return typed state objects, not raw data. Handle errors
  with try/catch and return error states.
- **Client Components:** Mark with `'use client'`. Keep them
  focused on UI and interaction. Import from `@/` path alias.
- **shadcn/ui:** Use existing shadcn/ui components from
  `components/ui/`. Add new ones with
  `pnpm dlx shadcn@latest add <component>`.
- **Import grouping:** React/Next.js imports, blank line,
  third-party, blank line, local `@/` imports. Within local
  imports: components, then lib, then types.
- **Tailwind CSS v4:** Use the CSS-first `@theme` configuration
  in `globals.css`. Use semantic colour tokens
  (`text-foreground`, `bg-muted`, `border-border`, etc.) not
  raw colours. Respect dark mode via the `.dark` class.
- **Naming:** PascalCase for components and types, camelCase for
  functions and variables. File names match the primary export
  (kebab-case for component files).

## Testing Standards

### Backend (pytest)

- Use `pytest` with `pytest-asyncio` (mode: `auto`).
- Test endpoints using `httpx.AsyncClient` with `ASGITransport`
  against the FastAPI `app` directly (no live server needed).
- Assert response status codes AND JSON payloads.
- Use `@pytest.mark.anyio` for async tests.
- Keep tests independent - no shared mutable state between tests.

### Frontend (Vitest)

- Use Vitest with `environment: 'node'`.
- Test files go in `frontend/tests/` with `.test.ts` extension.
- Contract tests validate Zod schemas with `.parse()` and
  `.safeParse()` against expected and malformed payloads.
- Use `describe`/`it` blocks with clear scenario descriptions.
- Assert with `expect()` matchers.

## Commands

### Backend

Run all tests:
```
cd backend && python -m pytest tests/ -v
```

Run specific test:
```
cd backend && python -m pytest tests/ -v -k <test_name>
```

Run linter and formatter:
```
cd backend && ruff check --fix . && ruff format .
```

Check lint without fixing (for review):
```
cd backend && ruff check . && ruff format --check .
```

### Frontend

Run all tests:
```
cd frontend && pnpm test
```

Run tests in watch mode:
```
cd frontend && pnpm test:watch
```

Run lint:
```
cd frontend && pnpm lint
```

Run format:
```
cd frontend && pnpm format
```

### Both (via run-dev.sh)

The `run-dev.sh` script at the repo root runs linting and tests
for both frontend and backend before starting dev servers:
```
./run-dev.sh
```
