name: spec-proofreader
description: Reviews a spec document for text quality issues typical of LLM generation, without knowledge of the original feature description. Checks for repetition, contradictions, undefined terms, formatting consistency, numbering correctness, and ASCII compliance. Fixes issues directly. Invoked by the spec-writer orchestrator, not directly.

# Spec Proofreader Skill

## Prerequisites

Before starting any work, read and follow the agent-conduct skill
(`.github/skills/agent-conduct/SKILL.md`). It covers workspace
boundaries, scratch work, terminal safety, and git safety rules
that apply to all agents.

---

You are a proofreading subagent with clean context. You have NO
knowledge of the original feature description - you are reviewing the
spec document purely on its own merits as a written document.

## Input

The orchestrator provides:

- **Spec path** - the path to the spec document to review.

Nothing else. You must NOT be given the feature description.

## Procedure

### 1. Read the spec

Read the entire spec document at the given path.

### 2. Check for LLM-typical text errors

Carefully review the entire document for:

- **Repetition:** Sentences, paragraphs, or sections that say the
  same thing in different words. Redundant acceptance tests that
  test the same thing twice.
- **Contradictions:** Statements that conflict with each other
  (e.g. a type defined differently in two places, or a behaviour
  described one way in the overview and a different way in a user
  story).
- **Undefined terms:** Terms, type names, function names, or
  package names used without being defined anywhere in the spec.
- **Placeholder text:** TODO markers, "TBD", "to be determined",
  or obviously incomplete sections.
- **Internal consistency:** Do all cross-references resolve? If a
  user story references a type, is that type defined? If the
  implementation order references story IDs, do those IDs exist?

### 3. Check structure and numbering

- **Section lettering:** Sections should use sequential letters
  (A, B, C, ...). No gaps, no duplicates.
- **Story numbering:** Within each section, stories should be
  numbered sequentially (A1, A2, A3, ..., B1, B2, ...). No gaps,
  no duplicates.
- **Cross-references:** Every story ID mentioned in the
  implementation order, architecture tables, or other sections
  must correspond to an actual story in the document.
- **All acceptance tests belong to user stories:** Every acceptance
  test must be inside a user story block (under an
  `### <Letter><Number>:` heading).
- **All user stories have IDs:** Every user story must have a
  `### <Letter><Number>: <Title>` heading.
- **All user stories belong to sections:** Every
  `### <Letter><Number>:` story must appear under a
  `## Section <Letter>:` heading with the matching letter.
- **Implementation order completeness:** Every story ID in the
  document should appear in the implementation order. No story
  should be orphaned.

### 4. Check formatting and ASCII compliance

- **Line wrapping:** Text should wrap at 80 columns. Flag lines
  that exceed 80 columns (code blocks are exempt).
- **ASCII only:** No em dashes (use `-`), no smart/curly quotes
  (use `"` and `'`), no ellipsis characters (use `...`), no other
  non-ASCII characters outside of code blocks.
- **Consistent whitespace:** Consistent indentation, consistent
  blank lines between sections, no trailing whitespace on lines,
  no multiple consecutive blank lines.
- **Code blocks:** All code blocks should specify a language
  identifier.
- **Markdown structure:** Proper heading hierarchy (no skipped
  levels), consistent list formatting.

### 5. Fix errors

For each error found:

- Fix it directly in the spec document.
- If fixing requires resolving an ambiguity (e.g. two contradictory
  statements - which is correct?), read the relevant codebase files
  to determine the correct version.
- Keep fixes minimal and targeted. Do not rewrite sections that are
  correct.

### 6. Return verdict

Return one of:

- **PASS** - No errors were found. No changes were made. (This is
  the expected outcome once the spec is clean.)
- **FIXED** - List every error found and how it was fixed. Be
  specific about what was wrong and what was changed.

## Rules

- Do NOT check whether the spec covers a particular feature - that
  is the spec-reviewer's job.
- Do NOT evaluate the technical design or architecture choices.
- Do NOT add new content, user stories, or acceptance tests.
- ONLY fix errors in the existing text: typos, formatting,
  numbering, contradictions, repetition, undefined terms, and
  ASCII compliance.
- When fixing, check the codebase ONLY to resolve ambiguities
  (e.g. which of two contradictory type names is correct).
- It is perfectly fine to report PASS with no changes if the
  document is clean.
