description: Full-stack implementation for this Next.js + FastAPI project. Provides the TDD cycle, contract workflow, and implementation process. References the conventions skill for architecture, code quality, testing standards, and commands. Use when implementing features, writing tests, creating new components or endpoints, or following a phase plan.

# Implementor Skill

## Prerequisites

Before starting any work:

1. Read and follow the agent-conduct skill
   (`.github/skills/agent-conduct/SKILL.md`). It covers workspace
   boundaries, scratch work, terminal safety, and git safety rules.
2. Read the conventions skill
   (`.github/skills/conventions/SKILL.md`). It defines the project
   stack, architecture principles, code quality standards, testing
   patterns, and commands that all implementation must follow.

## TDD Cycle

For each acceptance test or feature requirement, follow these steps.
Do not skip any step.

### Backend (Python)

1. Write a failing test in `backend/tests/` using pytest + httpx
   `AsyncClient` with `ASGITransport`.
2. Run: `cd backend && python -m pytest tests/ -v -k <test_name>`
3. Write minimal implementation to pass.
4. Refactor (clear names, type hints, docstrings, short functions).
5. Run linter: `cd backend && ruff check --fix . && ruff format .`
6. Re-run the test to confirm it still passes.

### Frontend (TypeScript)

1. Write a failing test in `frontend/tests/` using Vitest.
2. Run: `cd frontend && pnpm test`
3. Write minimal implementation to pass.
4. Refactor (clear names, proper types, extract helpers).
5. Run lint and format:
   `cd frontend && pnpm lint && pnpm format`
6. Re-run the test to confirm it still passes.

### Contract Tests

When adding or modifying an API endpoint, follow the contract
flow defined in the conventions skill (Pydantic model -> Zod
schema -> contract test -> `backendJson()` call):

1. Add a Vitest test in `frontend/tests/contracts.test.ts` that
   validates the Zod schema against expected payloads.
2. Add a pytest test in `backend/tests/test_api.py` that verifies
   the endpoint returns the expected JSON structure.
3. Ensure both schemas (Pydantic and Zod) agree on field names,
   types, and constraints.

### Frontend Design

For tasks involving UI design, component creation, or visual
styling, also read and follow the frontend-design skill
(`.github/skills/frontend-design/SKILL.md`) for design quality
standards, aesthetic guidelines, and creative direction.

## Implementation Workflow

1. Implement ONE item at a time. For each item:
   a. Read the relevant spec section for acceptance test details.
   b. Write tests first (backend pytest and/or frontend Vitest).
   c. Write minimal implementation to pass.
   d. Refactor.
   e. Run all linters.
   f. Confirm all tests pass.
2. When adding a new endpoint, follow the full contract flow:
   Pydantic model -> FastAPI endpoint -> Zod schema -> contract
   test -> Server Action -> component integration.
3. Consult spec.md for full acceptance test details, API designs,
   component specifications, and architecture decisions.
