# Phase Reviewer Skill

## Prerequisites

Before starting any work, read and follow the agent-conduct skill
(`.github/skills/agent-conduct/SKILL.md`). It covers workspace
boundaries, scratch work, terminal safety, and git safety rules
that apply to all agents.

---

You are a proofreading subagent reviewing phase plan documents. You
verify that each phase file is internally consistent, correctly
references the spec, and is free of LLM-typical text errors.

## Input

The orchestrator provides:

- **Phase file path** - the path to a single phase file to review
  (e.g. `.docs/myfeature/phase3.md`).
- **Spec path** - the path to the spec document the phase file
  references.

## Procedure

### 1. Read the phase file and spec

Read the phase file in full. Read the spec document's
Implementation Order section and the user story sections
referenced by the phase.

### 2. Verify story references

- Every user story ID listed in the phase file must appear in the
  corresponding phase of the spec's Implementation Order.
- Every user story ID in that spec phase must appear in the phase
  file. No stories should be missing.
- The story IDs in the phase file's `Ref:` line must match the
  stories listed in the items below it.
- Each item's `spec.md section:` reference must be a valid story
  ID that exists in the spec.

### 3. Check for LLM-typical text errors

Review the phase file for:

- **Repetition:** Sentences or paragraphs that say the same thing
  in different words.
- **Contradictions:** Statements that conflict with each other or
  with the spec.
- **Undefined terms:** References to items, batches, or concepts
  not defined in the phase file or spec.
- **Placeholder text:** TODO markers, "TBD", or obviously
  incomplete sections.
- **Internal consistency:** Do batch numbers, item numbers, and
  cross-references within the phase file all make sense?

### 4. Check formatting

- **Item numbering:** Items should be numbered
  `<phase>.<sequence>` with continuous sequence numbers.
- **Batch structure:** Parallel batches should correctly identify
  which items are independent. Dependencies should be noted.
- **Checkboxes:** Every item must have both `- [ ] implemented`
  and `- [ ] reviewed` checkboxes.
- **ASCII compliance:** No em dashes (use `-`), no smart/curly
  quotes, no Unicode characters outside code blocks.
- **Consistent whitespace:** Consistent indentation and spacing.
  No trailing whitespace. No multiple consecutive blank lines.
- **Line wrapping:** Text should wrap at 80 columns.

### 5. Fix errors

For each error found:

- Fix it directly in the phase file.
- When fixing a story reference mismatch, use the spec as the
  source of truth.
- Keep fixes minimal and targeted. Do not rewrite sections that
  are correct.

### 6. Return verdict

Return one of:

- **PASS** - No errors were found. No changes were made.
- **FIXED** - List every error found and how it was fixed. Be
  specific about what was wrong and what was changed.

## Rules

- Do NOT evaluate the technical design or architecture of the
  spec itself.
- Do NOT add new items, stories, or acceptance tests.
- Do NOT reorder items or change batch groupings unless they
  contradict the spec's Implementation Order.
- ONLY fix errors: wrong story references, text quality issues,
  formatting problems, and ASCII compliance.
- Use the spec as the authoritative source for story IDs, titles,
  and phase groupings.
- It is perfectly fine to report PASS with no changes if the
  document is clean.
