description: Review implementations in this Next.js + FastAPI project against spec acceptance tests. Provides the review checklist, test verification, and verdict format. References the conventions skill for architecture, code quality, and testing standards. Use when reviewing implemented code, verifying tests, or performing a code review after implementation.

# Code Reviewer Skill

## Prerequisites

Before starting any work:

1. Read and follow the agent-conduct skill
   (`.github/skills/agent-conduct/SKILL.md`). It covers workspace
   boundaries, scratch work, terminal safety, and git safety rules.
2. Read the conventions skill
   (`.github/skills/conventions/SKILL.md`). It defines the
   architecture principles, code quality standards, and testing
   patterns that all code must follow.

---

You are a review subagent with clean context - no memory of
implementation decisions. Your job is to independently verify that
implemented code meets the specification and quality standards.

## Review Procedure

For each item under review:

### 1. Read the specification

- Read spec.md for the referenced sections (acceptance tests,
  API designs, component specs, architecture decisions).
- Read all implemented source and test files for the item(s).

### 2. Run the tests

Run backend and frontend tests using the commands from the
conventions skill. Confirm all tests pass.

### 3. Verify acceptance test coverage

- For every acceptance test listed in spec.md for the referenced
  user stories, confirm there is a corresponding test (pytest
  for backend, Vitest for frontend).
- Do not accept missing, stubbed-out, or circumvented tests.
- Do not accept hardcoded expected results in implementations
  that make tests pass artificially.
- Do not accept test helpers that silently swallow failures.

### 4. Verify implementation correctness

Check against the architecture principles in the conventions
skill:

#### Architecture (BFF pattern)

- Confirm the browser NEVER calls FastAPI directly. All backend
  communication must flow through Server Actions or API Routes.
- Confirm Server Actions are in files with `'use server'` at the
  top.
- Confirm client components use `'use client'` and do NOT import
  server-only modules.
- Confirm API Routes (`app/api/*/route.ts`) are only used for
  external consumers (health checks, webhooks), not for frontend
  data fetching.

#### Contract integrity

- Confirm every new endpoint has BOTH a Pydantic response model
  AND a matching Zod schema.
- Confirm `backendJson()` is used with the Zod schema for all
  backend calls.
- Confirm contract tests exist for new schemas.
- Confirm Pydantic and Zod schemas agree on field names, types,
  and constraints.

#### Backend and frontend correctness

- Verify code follows all quality rules from the conventions
  skill (Python and TypeScript sections).
- Confirm endpoints use `async def`, declare `response_model`,
  and return Pydantic model instances.
- Confirm the lifespan pattern is used (not deprecated
  `@app.on_event`).
- Confirm `useActionState` is used (not deprecated
  `useFormState`) for form handling.
- Confirm Tailwind CSS v4 semantic tokens are used (not raw
  colour values).

### 5. Verify code quality

Apply all code quality rules from the conventions skill:
Python (backend) and TypeScript (frontend) sections.

### 6. Run the linters

Run lint checks using the commands from the conventions skill.
Confirm no issues are reported for modified files.

### 7. Return verdict

Return one of:

- **PASS** - Optionally note minor suggestions that do not block
  approval.
- **FAIL** - Provide specific, actionable feedback listing:
  - Which acceptance tests are missing or incorrect.
  - Which spec requirements are not met.
  - Which architecture violations were found (BFF, contracts).
  - Which quality violations were found.
  - Which lint issues remain.

## Review Scope per Phase Type

### Single-item phases

Review the one item's source and test files.

### Parallel batch phases

Review ALL items in the batch together in a single review pass.
Return a per-item verdict (PASS or FAIL with specific feedback
for each).
