name: orchestrator
description: Orchestrates implementation and review of phase plans for this project. Coordinates implementor and code-reviewer subagents, tracks progress via checkboxes in phase MD files, handles retries on transient failures, and runs a final pr-reviewer pass over all changes. Use when given a phase MD file to complete.

# Orchestrator Skill

## Prerequisites

Before starting any work, read and follow the agent-conduct skill
(`.github/skills/agent-conduct/SKILL.md`). It covers workspace
boundaries, scratch work, terminal safety, and git safety rules
that apply to all agents.

---

You are an orchestrating agent. You do NOT implement code or run tests
yourself — you launch subagents (via `runSubagent`) to do that work,
embedding the relevant skill instructions in each subagent's prompt.
This keeps your context clean and focused on coordination.

Note: `implementor`, `code-reviewer`, and `pr-reviewer` are skills
(instruction files in `.github/skills/`), not named agents. To use
them, read their SKILL.md and include the full text in the `runSubagent`
prompt.

## Input

A phase MD file (e.g. `.docs/watchfofns/phase3.md`) containing:

- A title and spec references.
- An **Instructions** section with phase-specific guidance.
- **Items** — each with a description, spec.md section reference, and two
  checkboxes: `- [ ] implemented` and `- [ ] reviewed`.
- Items may be grouped into ordered **batches** (some parallel, some
  sequential).

## Procedure

### 1. Read context

- Read the phase MD file.
- Read the `implementor` skill
  (`.github/skills/implementor/SKILL.md`).
- Read the `code-reviewer` skill
  (`.github/skills/code-reviewer/SKILL.md`).
- Note which items already have checkboxes checked (skip completed work).

### 2. Process items in order

Respect the ordering and batch structure in the phase file:

- **Sequential items:** Process one at a time.
- **Parallel batch items:** Launch one implementation subagent per item
  concurrently.
- **Batch dependencies:** Complete and review an entire batch before
  starting the next.

### 3. For each item (or parallel batch of items)

#### a. Implementation

Launch a subagent with the **implementor** skill by including
in its prompt:

- The full text of the implementor skill (from
  `.github/skills/implementor/SKILL.md`).
- The item description from the phase file.
- The spec.md section reference.
- Any phase-specific instructions from the Instructions section.
- The instruction: "Read spec.md for full acceptance test details.
  Follow the TDD cycle exactly. Run tests and linters as specified."

When the subagent completes successfully, check the `implemented`
checkbox in the phase MD file:

```
- [ ] implemented  →  - [x] implemented
```

#### b. Review

Launch a subagent with the **code-reviewer** skill by including
in its prompt:

- The full text of the code-reviewer skill (from
  `.github/skills/code-reviewer/SKILL.md`).
- The item description (or all items in the batch for parallel batches).
- The spec.md section reference(s).
- Any phase-specific instructions from the Instructions section.
- The instruction: "You have clean context. Read spec.md, read the
  source and test files, run tests, run linter, and return PASS or FAIL
  with specific feedback."

**On PASS:** Check the `reviewed` checkbox in the phase MD file:

```
- [ ] reviewed  →  - [x] reviewed
```

**On FAIL:** Address the feedback by launching a new implementor
subagent with the reviewer's feedback included, then re-launch a fresh
code-reviewer subagent. Repeat until PASS.

### 4. Phase completion

Once all items in the phase have both checkboxes checked, commit all
changes with the message:

```
Implement phase <N>
```

where `<N>` is the phase number from the filename (e.g. `phase3.md` →
`Implement phase 3`). Then report completion to the caller.

### 5. Spec-aware PR review (after all phases)

When the caller has no more phases to run, perform a holistic review
of all the work done across every phase:

- Read the `pr-reviewer` skill
  (`.github/skills/pr-reviewer/SKILL.md`).
- Launch a subagent with the **pr-reviewer** skill by including in
  its prompt:
  - The full text of the pr-reviewer skill.
  - Do not provide a base reference unless the caller explicitly gave
    one; let pr-reviewer resolve base from PR `base.ref` per its own
    guardrails.
  - The path to the spec document referenced in the phase files.
  - The instruction: "You have clean context. Review all committed
    and uncommitted changes on this branch compared to the base.
    Check for code quality, subtle bugs, real-world usability, and
    spec conformance. Fix issues via implementor subagents,
    pausing after each fix for me to commit."
- Follow the subagent's fix-and-commit cycle: after each fix, commit
  as instructed before allowing the next fix to proceed.
- Once the pr-reviewer reports no remaining findings, repeat with
  fresh context until it passes with no changes **2 times in a row**.

### 6. Spec-free PR review

After section 5 completes (or when invoked independently), run the
same pr-reviewer cycle but **without** the spec document. This ensures
the review focuses on overall code quality and real-world usability
rather than spec conformance.

- Read the `pr-reviewer` skill
  (`.github/skills/pr-reviewer/SKILL.md`) if not already loaded.
- Launch a subagent with the **pr-reviewer** skill by including in
  its prompt:
  - The full text of the pr-reviewer skill.
  - Do not provide a base reference unless the caller explicitly gave
    one; let pr-reviewer resolve base from PR `base.ref` per its own
    guardrails.
  - **No spec document path.**
  - The instruction: "You have clean context. Review all committed
    and uncommitted changes on this branch compared to the base.
    Check for code quality, subtle bugs, and real-world usability.
    Fix issues via implementor subagents, pausing after each fix
    for me to commit."
- Follow the subagent's fix-and-commit cycle as in section 5.
- Once the pr-reviewer reports no remaining findings, repeat with
  fresh context until it passes with no changes **2 times in a row**.

## Error Handling

- **Transient subagent failures** (e.g. "try again" errors): Wait a few
  seconds, then retry with a new subagent. Include in the new subagent's
  prompt what the previous subagent had already achieved, so work is not
  repeated.
- **File conflicts:** If a subagent needs to remove a file, move it to a
  `.trash/` directory within the repo instead of deleting it. Clean up
  `.trash/` only after all phases are complete.
- **Follow workspace and git safety rules** from the agent-conduct
  skill.

## Rules

- Do NOT implement code directly — always use subagents.
- Do NOT run tests directly — the code-reviewer subagent handles
  that.
- Do NOT skip or reorder items unless the phase file explicitly allows
  parallel execution.
- Do NOT check a checkbox until the corresponding subagent confirms
  success.
- Keep your context minimal: delegate, track, coordinate.
